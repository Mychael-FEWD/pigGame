Practice project - Pig Game - testing DOM manipulation

Project is used from Jonas Schmedtmann's: The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!

Project is designed to test DOM manipulation and show how JS can interact effectively with HTML and CSS.

Overview:
The Pig Game is a game with two players that takes a dice roll and each player attempts to reach a certain number first. If the dice roll hits 1 then they lose the sum of their current rolls and the active player is swapped. If the active player holds their current dice rolls before rolling a 1 then their current run is saved to a player game total and the active player is swapped only if the active player holds and their game total is not greater than the target number for winning the game. When this target number is reached by the active player, then the styles and appearance of the game should change to represent that the active player has won.
Game should include a roll button, a hold button for each player, and a reset button for when the game is won.
